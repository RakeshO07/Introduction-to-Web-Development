        "\n",
        "    (a)   Client: The client is the end user's device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) that interacts with the server. It sends requests to the server and displays the received responses. Examples: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox) acting as clients to access websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "    (b) Server: A centralized computer or system that stores, processes, and delivers resources and services to clients. Handles client requests, processes data, and sends back responses. Examples: Web servers (Apache, Nginx), database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL).\n",
        "\n",
        "    (c)   Request/Response Model: Clients send requests to the server using protocols like HTTP/HTTPS. The server processes the request and sends back the required data as a response. Example: A user enters a URL in a browser (request), and the server sends the webpage data (response).\n",
        "\n",
        "    (d)   Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server is independent, meaning the server does not retain any previous request information. Stateless protocols like HTTP ensure scalability and efficient handling of multiple users. Example: When browsing a website, each page request is treated as a separate transaction.\n",
